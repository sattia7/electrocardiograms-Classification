# ❤️ ECG Temporal Data Classification 

## 📌 Overview

Temporal data refers to data where **order and time matter**.  
In this exercise, we work with **electrocardiogram (ECG)** signals — recordings of the electrical activity of the heart over time.

Your task is to:

> **Classify a given ECG sequence into one of 5 heartbeat categories.**

Some of these categories represent **normal heartbeats**, while others correspond to **heart dysfunctions (arrhythmias)**.

## 🫀 What Is an ECG?

An **Electrocardiogram (ECG)** measures the electrical signals generated by the heart as it beats.

An ECG signal is:

- A time-series signal
- A 1D numerical sequence
- Represented as voltage values over time

Each heartbeat produces a characteristic waveform:

- **P wave**
- **QRS complex**
- **T wave**

Abnormal heartbeats modify this waveform shape.

## 📊 Nature of the Dataset

The dataset consists of:

- Multiple ECG sequences
- Each sequence represents one heartbeat
- Each sequence has:
  - A fixed number of time steps (e.g., 187 samples)
  - A label indicating the heartbeat type

### 🎯 Target Variable

There are **5 heartbeat classes**, typically:

1. Normal heartbeat  
2. Supraventricular ectopic beat  
3. Ventricular ectopic beat  
4. Fusion beat  
5. Unknown or other abnormal beat  

(Some classes represent heart dysfunctions.)

## 🧠 Why This Is a Temporal Classification Problem

This is **not** a standard tabular classification problem.

Why?

Because:

- Each sample is a **sequence**
- The order of values matters
- The shape of the waveform determines the class
- Past time steps influence interpretation of later ones

Therefore, this is a:

> **Many-to-One Sequence Classification Problem**

Sequence input → Single output class

## 🔎 Objective of the Exercise

Build a model that:

1. Takes an ECG sequence as input  
2. Learns temporal patterns  
3. Outputs one of 5 heartbeat classes  

In other words:

\[
f(sequence) \rightarrow class\_label
\]

## 🏗 Recommended Model Types

Since the data is sequential, suitable models include:

### 🔹 RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
Captures temporal dependencies using hidden states.

### 🔹 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Handles long-term dependencies better than standard RNN.

### 🔹 GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
Computationally efficient alternative to LSTM.
